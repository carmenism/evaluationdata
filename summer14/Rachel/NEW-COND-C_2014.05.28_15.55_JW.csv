Condition,C,Initials,JW,Gender,Female,College,COLSA,What is the effect on herring?,Decreased a little,3Why?,"Harvesting small pelogies decreases the amount of herring, noted by the decrease in population from baseline (shadow). Also notice the positive competition effect on the mackerel and herring species.",2What is the effect on winter flounder?,Increased a lot,3Why?,The decrease in harvesting of flatflish has a positive effect on winter flounder population. This decreases the competition with other flatfish species like windowpane and yellowtail flounder noted by the arrows and blue arch.,2What is the effect on yellowtail flounder?,Increased a little,2Why?,"Both windowpane and winter flounder compete with yellowtail, and since their populations increased due to a decrease in harvesting of flatfish, it decreases their competition effect in turn increasing yellowtails population.",2.75What is the effect on skates?,Decreased a lot,3Why?,"a negative effect, notice the large purple shadow from an increase in harvesting. This has a positive effect on predation and competition with many other fish species.",2What is the effect on cod?,Decreased a lot,0Why?,"From the positive effect on predation and competition from the increase in harvesting of elasmobranches, in turn increasing the population of cod.",1What is the effect on haddock?,Decreased a little,2Why?,The effect on cod (increased population) caused a decrease in haddock population from a negative effect on competition.,3What is the effect on windowpane?,Decreased a little,1Why?,"From the positive effect on competition from the decrease in elasmobranch and indirectly from other fish like haddock, etc.",1
