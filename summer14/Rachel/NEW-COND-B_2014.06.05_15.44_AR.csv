Condition,B,Initials,AR,Gender,Male,College,COLA,What is the effect on herring?,Decreased a little,3Why?,Increase in harvesting effort on small pelogics forced biomass of herring to decrease.,2What is the effect on winter flounder?,Increased a lot,3Why?,With less harvesting of the flatfish the winter flounder were able to increase their biomass by more than double,2What is the effect on yellowtail flounder?,Stayed about the same,3Why?,The yellowtail flounder remained generally the same in biomass with a steady increase over time. Possibly due to competition with other flatfish such as winter flounder,3What is the effect on skates?,Decreased a lot,3Why?,Increase in fishing efforts decreases the biomass of the species skates because of human harvesting efforts. ,2What is the effect on cod?,Increased a lot,3Why?,"With less elasmobranchs like spiny dogfish to predate on cod, the biomass increased",3What is the effect on haddock?,Decreased a little,2Why?,Decrease in dogfish predation on cod increased competition for food with the haddock which caused drop in biomass.,3What is the effect on windowpane?,Decreased a lot,3Why?,"Over time the decrease in competiton between windowpane and skates most likely caused the population of windowpane to boom. Once their population reached its highest density, lack of food most likely caused decrease in biomass density",0
